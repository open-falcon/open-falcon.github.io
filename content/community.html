      Open-Falcon is developed in the open. Here are some of the channels we use
      to communicate and contribute:
    </p>
    <p>

        <li><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openfalcon-developers">openfalcon-developers</a> – for discussions around openfalcon development</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Issue tracker:</strong> Use the GitHub issue tracker
      for the various <a href="http://github.com/open-falcon">Open-Falcon
      repositories</a> to file bugs and features request.
      If you need support, please send your questions to the
      <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openfalcon-users">openfalcon-users</a>
      mailing list rather than filing a GitHub issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Please do not ask individual project members for

      community can help you and benefit from the solutions
      provided. If community support is insufficient for your
      situation, please refer to the Commercial Support section
      below.</em>
